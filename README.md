# YOLO Computer Vision

This project demonstrates the implementation of YOLO (You Only Look Once), a fast and accurate real-time object detection algorithm used for computer vision tasks. The goal of this repository is to show how YOLO can be applied for various object detection tasks using Python.

## Features
- Real-time object detection using YOLO.
- Supports various YOLO models for different use cases.
- Object detection on images, videos, and real-time webcam streams.

## Installation
